Usually, most of the taps in the are operated using old system where it controlled manually to turn on and off the system . When the that system is being used they must use their hand to open or close the tap where there is also a possibility of valve damage , because the users always turn strongly to open or close the tap. This system is not efficient because water wastage occurs easily at the time between opening the tap and washing their hands.We may also forget to close the tap after our work is done which makes the wastag more critical . As we can see usage of sink only focuses on one usage which is all about water. Looking at the development of technology the usage of sink should not be limited only to water usage but more than that. Not only the usable water but also the edible form of fluids like Drinking Water , Soft Drinks,etc can also be used.Automatic Water Dispenser deals with the above mentioned issues and can efficiently save water .
